My name is Chelsea Biala, and I'm a rising third year undergraduate computer science student at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I have experience with Java, C++, Python, Javascript, and CSS. I am interested in artificial intelligence and technology and data ethics, as well.

I am also experienced in software quality assurance/testing, especially Python unit testing and Selenium. I have extensive experience with Git and Linux. I tend to prefer emacs over vim (though I've gone back and forth more than I'd like to admit).

In my free time, I enjoy exercising, reading Stephen King novels, listening to alt rock, and exploring LA and Chicago with my friends!
